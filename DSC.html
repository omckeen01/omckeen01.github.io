    <h2>Cabinet Overview</h2>
    <p>The Dean’s Student Cabinet is a Leeds-sponsored, student-led initiative that aims towards creating a positive shift in the Leeds Culture and uniting the community. Over the past six years, the initiative has worked towards accomplishing these overarching goals through the development of our Leeds Values: Academic Excellence, Integrity, Inclusion, Community, and Forward-Looking. 

        We have strived towards integrating these values into the Leeds culture through student engagement events, community service events, and the classroom experience. Some past accomplishments include speaker events with corporate executives, Ellen Balaguer, Justin Gold of Justin’s Nut Butters, a school-wide food drive, and the adoption of the Leeds Values into numerous curriculum syllabi. Working closely with students, staff, and faculty, the student-led committee takes responsibility for the ideation and implementation of community-wide initiatives. 
        
        The committee is currently recruiting new members who are passionate about working for positive change in the Leeds community.</p>
